1. Express.js API Gateway
Acts as the frontend API gateway receiving prediction requests from clients.
Validates incoming requests before forwarding to your Python ML backend.
Implements middleware for logging, retrying failed requests, and optionally caching responses.
Optional integration point for Kafka consumer (if you want your API to consume Kafka streams directly).

2. Python ML Backend Service
Your existing FastAPI backend serves this role by exposing /predict.
Add middleware for request logging, error handling, caching if needed (e.g., using fastapi.middleware or external libraries).
Implement retries using client-side logic (e.g., in Express), or decorate prediction calls in backend if calling internal services.

3. Kafka Consumer Integration
You can run Kafka consumer as a separate microservice or embed it in either backend.
If integrating in Express.js, use Kafka clients like kafkajs.
For Python backend, continue using kafka-python or confluent-kafka.
Decide based on your architecture preferences; standalone services are recommended for scalability and separation.
