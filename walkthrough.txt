------------------
Phase 1
------------------
A. Set up Blockchain Data Fetcher
Use the Alchemy or Infura Python SDK (e.g., alchemy-sdk for Alchemy or web3.py for generic Ethereum).
Implement a script (fetcher.py) that:
Connects to Ethereum node via Alchemy/Infura API.
Subscribes or polls for new blocks, transactions, or events.
Extracts relevant data (transaction volume, token transfers, contract events).
Sends the structured data to Kafka through a producer module.

B. Set up Apache Kafka
If Kafka is not already available, set up a local Kafka instance using Docker for easier development.
Define Kafka topics like ethereum-data to receive blockchain streams.
Implement a Kafka producer (in Python or Node.js) inside your data_fetcher/ that sends Ethereum data to the topic.
Build a simple Kafka consumer (optional for test phase) to verify messages are received properly.

Set up Local Kafka Using Docker
Use Docker Compose to run Kafka locally with all needed components.
Kafka requires a ZooKeeper or can run in KRaft mode (without ZooKeeper).
Run Kafka with: docker-compose up -d
Kafka will be accessible on localhost:9092.

Create Kafka Topic
Kafka can auto-create topics when the producer sends messages if configured.
Alternatively, manually create a topic with Kafka CLI (available inside the container or installed locally):
kafka-topics --create --topic ethereum-data --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
Kafka Producer (Python)
Use kafka-python library to send Ethereum data to Kafka topic ethereum-data.

Verify Kafka is accessible
Run inside the container:
docker exec -it kafka bash
Then, check topics:
kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
If no topics yet, that’s fine — we’ll create one.

Create your ethereum-data topic
(You can skip if auto-topic creation is true in your Docker config)
docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics \
  --create \
  --topic ethereum-data \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --partitions 1 \
  --replication-factor 1
Test with a simple producer/consumer
We can quickly test Kafka before wiring it into our blockchain fetcher.(test-producer.py)
Run producer: python3 test_producer.py
Then consumer: python3 test_consumer.py
You should see:
Received: {'msg': 'Hello from Kafka!'}


C. Integrate Ethereum Data Fetcher with Kafka Producer
Import KafkaProducer in your fetcher script
Use kafka-python to produce messages to Kafka.
Initialize Kafka producer
Connect to your local Kafka broker (e.g., localhost:9092).
Fetch Ethereum block data using Alchemy SDK
Continuously poll for new blocks.
Extract relevant data from blocks
Such as block number, timestamp, transaction count, gas used, token transfers.
Send the extracted data as JSON messages to Kafka
Use the Kafka producer to send to your ethereum-data topic.
Flush producer messages and log sends
To ensure reliability and observability.



D. Organize Data Schema and Streaming Format
Define JSON schemas for data payloads, e.g.,

E. Build a Kafka Consumer Service
Develop a Kafka consumer (in Python or Node.js/Express) that listens to the ethereum-data topic, receives the streamed Ethereum block data, and processes it as needed. This consumer will be the bridge to the ML backend in the next phase.
This service will:
Listen continuously to the ethereum-data Kafka topic.
Receive the streamed Ethereum block data.
Process or transform the data as needed.
Forward the processed data to your ML backend for prediction (in the next phase).


------------------
Phase 2
------------------

A. Defining ML Inputs and Targets
Analyze your available blockchain data schema and determine which features (block metrics, transaction counts, token transfers) will be input variables for your ML models.
Define prediction objectives (e.g., anomaly detection, price prediction, fraud detection).

Analyze Available Blockchain Data Schema and Features
Your current blockchain data payload streamed through Kafka includes:
blockNumber: Ethereum block height (integer)
timestamp: Unix timestamp of the block (integer)
transactionsCount: Number of transactions in the block (integer)
gasUsed: Total gas used in the block (string representing integer)
tokenTransfers: List of token transfer events, each with:
tokenAddress
from (sender address)
to (recipient address)
amount (string number)

Block-level aggregated features (per block)
Block height (blockNumber) — as a time ordering feature or for temporal sequence models
Time features extracted from timestamp (e.g., hour of day, day of week)
Number of transactions (transactionsCount)
Gas consumption (gasUsed, converted to numeric)
Number of token transfers (length of tokenTransfers array)
Aggregated token transfer amounts by token (sum of amounts per tokenAddress)
Unique sender/receiver counts (count of unique 'from' and 'to' addresses) within tokenTransfers
Volume metrics for major tokens or token categories (if classified)
Gas price averages or median (if you can extract or enrich)

Transaction-level or Transfer-level features (optional detailed granularity)
Specific token transfer features (individual transfer amount, sender, receiver patterns)
Token categories, token popularity indices (external enrichment can be added)
Transaction fees or input data complexity (if available)

B. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Build pipelines to preprocess the raw streamed data into ML-ready formats.
Feature normalization, aggregation, extraction from token transfers, and temporal feature creation.

C. ML Model Selection and Training
Select appropriate model types (e.g., classical ML, Neural Networks, Transformer-based models like LLaMA3 if applicable).
Train your models offline on historical blockchain data.

D. Model Serving and Integration
Develop a Python ML backend service (Django, FastAPI) with /predict API endpoint.
Integrate your Kafka consumer to forward processed blockchain data for real-time inference.
Evaluation and Iteration
Monitor model performance in production.
Iterate on feature sets, model hyperparameters, and data streaming quality.


___________________
1. Save Extracted Features from Kafka Consumer into features.json
As your Kafka consumer consumes raw block data, you run your feature extraction function (extract_features) that converts raw blockchain events to numeric ML features.
Accumulate these feature dictionaries in a list.
Periodically or on shutdown, save this accumulated feature list as a JSON file named features.json.
This file serves as a base dataset of raw features extracted from the blockchain stream.

2. Prepare labels.json
Separately, you prepare or collect your supervised labels mapped to block numbers.
Labels depend on your ML task (e.g., anomaly flags, price movements).
Save these labels in JSON format, typically as a dictionary mapping blockNumber (int) to label (int or categorical).
This can come from external datasets, manual annotation, or derived calculations.

3. Run prepare_training_data.py
This script loads features.json and labels.json.
Merges the features with their corresponding labels based on blockNumber.
Saves the combined data as training_dataset.csv.
This CSV is your final labeled dataset ready for ML training.

4. Train Model Using training_dataset.csv in train_model.py
Your training script loads training_dataset.csv.
Splits into train/test sets.
Trains your ML model (e.g., Random Forest).
Evaluates performance.
Saves the trained model as rf_model.pkl.

5. ML Backend Loads Saved Model rf_model.pkl
Your ML backend service (e.g., FastAPI app) loads rf_model.pkl at startup.
Exposes a /predict POST endpoint that:
Accepts incoming feature data,
Runs inference using the loaded model,
Returns predictions to the caller (e.g., your Kafka consumer or another client).


Correct Order of Running Your Files
Run your Kafka Consumer with Feature Extraction and Feature Accumulation
This consumes raw blockchain data from Kafka.
Extracts features per block using extract_features().
Accumulates those feature dicts into a list and periodically saves to features.json.
If your current consumer doesn't save to features.json, update it to do so (e.g., batch save every N records or on shutdown).
Practical Recommendations:
Start with 1,000 to 5,000 blocks worth of feature data as a reasonable initial dataset for training classical ML models like Random Forests.
If blocks are produced roughly every 12-15 seconds (Ethereum average), 1,000 blocks correspond to about 3-4 hours of data.
You can always grow this dataset over time and retrain models for better performance.

Create or Prepare your Labels JSON (labels.json)
Either manually create a labels.json file mapping block numbers to labels,
Or write a separate script to generate labels based on external data sources (price feeds, known anomalies, gas spikes, etc.).

Run the Dataset Preparation Script: prepare_training_data.py
This script loads both features.json and labels.json.
Merges the features with labels by block number.
Saves out the combined labeled dataset training_dataset.csv.

Run Your Model Training Script: train_model.py (or equivalent)
Loads training_dataset.csv.
Trains your ML model (e.g., Random Forest).
Saves the trained model to rf_model.pkl.

Start Your ML Backend with the Saved Model (endpoints.py)
Loads the rf_model.pkl.
Serves the /predict endpoint for inference.
___________________


Set Up the Python ML Backend / Model Server
Create your machine learning model serving service using Django or FastAPI. This service will expose a /predict API endpoint to receive processed blockchain data and run predictions or classifications using your trained ML models.

Connect Consumer to ML Backend
Integrate the Kafka consumer service so that it forwards incoming Ethereum block data to the ML backend for inference, either synchronously or via an internal messaging system.

Develop Data Preprocessing and ML Models
Continue developing your blockchain-specific preprocessing logic and start training or loading predictive ML models with TensorFlow/PyTorch/LLaMA3.

Optional: Build the Express API Gateway and React (Next.js) Frontend
After your backend prediction pipeline is ready, build the Express.js API gateway that clients can access and a React/Next.js dashboard to visualize predictions and insights.
