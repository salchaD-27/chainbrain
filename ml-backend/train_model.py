# Evaluate
# Makes predictions on the test set.
# Prints a classification report:
# Precision: out of all predicted positives, how many are actually positive?
# Recall: out of all actual positives, how many did we predict?
# F1-score: harmonic mean of precision and recall.
# Support: number of occurrences of each class in y_test
